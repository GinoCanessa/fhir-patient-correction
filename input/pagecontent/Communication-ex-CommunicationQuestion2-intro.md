Hi Mr. Schmidt,

This is John Schmitt.  I work for nowhere organization.  I have been assigned to your Correction Request from *December 12th, 2020*. 

I received your clarification on *December 14th, 2020* indicating that you have stopped smoking in **1998**. Your chart shows that you have started and stopped smoking a few times.

| Status | Date |

| started | 1969 |
| stopped | 1972 |
| started | 1983 |


is this accurate?
